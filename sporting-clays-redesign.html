    <p class="paragraph-2 mobile-visible opacity-90 max-width p affinity-map-para">From here, we used these pain points to clarify with clients and their staff, the priority of them and started to identify solutions and prioritize features. There are Miro notes that I took through client meetings while reformatting the scope of the project. We later used these for feature prioritization. To clarify, these screen shots were almost exclusively based off of our client&#x27;s prioritization. We will reshuffle during further feature prioritization soon!<br></p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-_49a282d0-1580-3e66-c530-d3601ff8a2ef-c5da14f8" sizes="100vw" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM.png 1008w" alt="Screen shot of customer needs stickies" class="image-10">
