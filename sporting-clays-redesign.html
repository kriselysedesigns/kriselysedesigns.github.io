Through research process and discovery with stakeholders, we began to narrow down the new site&#x27;s priorities as;<br></p><img src="images/meet-your-teacher.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="images/meet-your-teacher-p-500.png 500w, images/meet-your-teacher-p-800.png 800w, images/meet-your-teacher-p-1080.png 1080w, images/meet-your-teacher-p-1600.png 1600w, images/meet-your-teacher.png 1841w" alt="Picture of meet your teacher pages on AESA learning platform

The popularity and importance of the information on this page was later confirmed through our research. <br><br>The information that our client found the most useful from this analysis were;<br>The majority (35%) of users between age 25-35 (this was younger than expected by our client, but inline with their goal demographic)<br>A larger percentage of female visitors than expected.

    <p class="paragraph-2 mobile-visible opacity-90 max-width p affinity-map-para">From here, we used these pain points to clarify with clients and their staff, the priority of them and started to identify solutions and prioritize features. There are Miro notes that I took through client meetings while reformatting the scope of the project. We later used these for feature prioritization. To clarify, these screen shots were almost exclusively based off of our client&#x27;s prioritization. We will reshuffle during further feature prioritization soon!<br></p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-_49a282d0-1580-3e66-c530-d3601ff8a2ef-f2ef0438" sizes="100vw" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2022-12-26-at-7.05.59-PM.png 1008w" alt="Screen shot of customer needs stickies" class="image-10">
